# Hinterland Battleground UI Fixes

## Summary of Changes

We've made several important fixes to the Hinterland Battleground addon to address UI errors that were occurring in the client. These changes improve compatibility with WoW 3.3.5a and fix specific issues with scroll frames and timers.

### Primary Issues Fixed:

1. **Scroll Frame Naming Issue**
   - Problem: Error "Attempt to concatenate a nil value" in UIPanelTemplates.lua:255
   - Root Cause: The ScrollFrames created for the UI tabs were not properly named, causing errors when the WoW UI tries to access elements by name
   - Solution: Added explicit naming to all scroll frames and added a fix function to ensure names are correctly set

2. **Missing C_Timer API**
   - Problem: Error "Attempt to index global 'C_Timer' (a nil value)"
   - Root Cause: The addon was using C_Timer API which doesn't exist in WoW 3.3.5a (it was added in later expansions)
   - Solution: Created a complete compatibility layer that implements C_Timer.After, C_Timer.Cancel, and C_Timer.NewTicker

3. **Error Handling**
   - Problem: Errors would propagate and potentially break UI functionality
   - Solution: Added a SafeCall wrapper to catch errors and prevent them from breaking the entire addon

### Files Added/Modified:

- **New Files:**
  - `HLBG_Compatibility.lua`: New compatibility layer for WoW 3.3.5a
  
- **Modified Files:**
  - `HLBG_UI_Helpers.lua`: Removed redundant C_Timer implementation and now uses the compatibility layer
  - `HinterlandAffixHUD.toc`: Updated to load the compatibility layer first and bumped version to 1.5.3

### Implementation Details:

1. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Full C_Timer API implementation compatible with WoW 3.3.5a
   - Version detection to conditionally add compatibility functions
   - Added missing utility functions (string.split, string.trim, table.wipe)
   - SafeCall function for better error handling

2. **UI Fixes**
   - Ensured all scroll frames have explicit names
   - Added a delayed fix function that runs shortly after the addon loads
   - Used pcall for error handling in timer callbacks

### Testing Instructions:

1. Install the updated addon files
2. Launch the game and login to a character
3. Open the Hinterland Battleground UI
4. Verify that all tabs (Info, Settings, Stats, History) can be opened without errors
5. Test scrolling in each tab to ensure scroll frames work correctly
6. Check the chat window for any error messages related to the addon

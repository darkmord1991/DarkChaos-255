# Hotspot Display Addon - Installation Guide

**Quick Start Guide for Players**

---

## Step 1: Locate Your WoW Folder

Find your World of Warcraft installation directory:

**Common Locations:**
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\`
- `C:\Games\World of Warcraft\`
- `D:\World of Warcraft\`

---

## Step 2: Navigate to AddOns Folder

Inside your WoW folder, navigate to:
```
World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\
```

If the `AddOns` folder doesn't exist, create it:
```
World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\
```

---

## Step 3: Install the Addon

Copy the entire `HotspotDisplay` folder to the AddOns directory:

**From:**
```
DarkChaos-255\Custom\Client addons needed\HotspotDisplay\
```

**To:**
```
World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\HotspotDisplay\
```

**Final Structure:**
```
World of Warcraft\
â””â”€â”€ Interface\
    â””â”€â”€ AddOns\
        â””â”€â”€ HotspotDisplay\
            â”œâ”€â”€ HotspotDisplay.toc
            â”œâ”€â”€ Core.lua
            â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation

### Method 1: Character Select Screen
1. Launch World of Warcraft
2. At character selection, click **"AddOns"** button (bottom-left)
3. Look for **"Hotspot Display"** in the list
4. Make sure it's **checked** (enabled)
5. Click **"Okay"**

### Method 2: In-Game Check
1. Log in to your character
2. Look for this message in chat:
   ```
   [Hotspot Display] Loaded v1.0
   [Hotspot Display] Type /hotspot for options
   ```
3. Type `/hotspot status` to verify it's working

---

## Step 5: Test the Addon

### Find a Hotspot
1. Wait for server announcement:
   ```
   [Hotspot] A new XP Hotspot has appeared in Eastern Kingdoms! (+100% XP)
   ```
2. Use `.hotspots list` (if you're a GM) or ask a GM for location
3. Travel to the hotspot location

### Verify Functionality
1. When you enter the hotspot, you should:
   - Hear a sound (auction house opening)
   - See chat message: "You are in an XP Hotspot! Check your map."
   - See buff icon "Sayge's Dark Fortune of Strength" in your buff bar

2. Open your map (press `M`)
3. You should see **gold "XP+100%" text** at your character position
4. The text should pulse slowly

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Addon not in list"

**Solution:**
1. Double-check folder name is exactly `HotspotDisplay` (case-sensitive on some systems)
2. Verify files are in the correct location
3. Restart WoW completely (close and reopen)
4. Try deleting `Cache` folder in WoW directory (WoW will regenerate it)

### Issue: "Addon loads but no text on map"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're actually in a hotspot (check for buff icon)
2. Type `/hotspot status` to check if addon is enabled
3. Type `/hotspot text` to ensure map text is enabled
4. Try `/reload` to reload UI

### Issue: "Out of date" warning

**Solution:**
1. Click "Load out of date AddOns" at character select
2. Or enable "Load out of date AddOns" in Interface options

---

## Uninstalling

To remove the addon:

1. Close World of Warcraft
2. Navigate to `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\`
3. Delete the `HotspotDisplay` folder
4. (Optional) Delete saved settings:
   - `World of Warcraft\WTF\Account\<ACCOUNT>\<SERVER>\<CHARACTER>\SavedVariables\HotspotDisplayDB.lua`

---

## Using the Addon

Once installed, the addon works automatically:

1. **No configuration needed** - Works out of the box
2. **Automatic detection** - Detects hotspots via buff
3. **Map display** - Open map (`M` key) to see XP+ text when in hotspot

**Slash Commands:**
```
/hotspot           # Show help
/hotspot status    # Check status
/hotspot size 20   # Adjust text size
```

---

## Updating the Addon

If a new version is released:

1. Close World of Warcraft
2. Delete old `HotspotDisplay` folder
3. Copy new `HotspotDisplay` folder to AddOns
4. Launch WoW

Your settings will be preserved (stored in SavedVariables).

Place the converted BLP or PNG texture named azshara_crater.png (or .blp) here.
- For classic 3.3.5a clients prefer BLP format. If you can't convert, PNG may still work depending on client build.
- Recommended size: keep the image aspect ratio close to the world frame; scale in addon may need tweaks.

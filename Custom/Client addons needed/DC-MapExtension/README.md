DC-MapExtension

This addon provides custom worldmap backgrounds and POI overlays for DarkChaos server.

Installation:
- Copy the `DC-MapExtension` folder into your World of Warcraft `Interface\AddOns` directory.
- Convert included PNG textures to BLP if necessary for your client and replace files in the `Textures` folder.

Usage:
- Open the world map (M) while standing in map 37 (Azshara Crater) to see the custom background.
- Use `/dcmap debug` to force-show the Azshara map background and a sample POI.

Notes:
- The addon includes a simple data table for POIs. Later we will accept server-sent payloads for dynamic hotspots.

# ✅ Map Conversion Complete - Azshara Crater

## What Was Done

### 1. Converted Full Map to Tiles
- **Source**: `C:\Users\flori\Desktop\WoW Server\azshara_crater.png` (1024x683)
- **Output**: 12 tiles in 4x3 grid, each 512x512 pixels
- **Format**: TGA (uncompressed, WoW 3.3.5a native support)
- **Location**: `Textures/AzsharaCrater/AzsharaCrater1.tga` through `AzsharaCrater12.tga`

### 2. Updated Addon Code
- Changed all texture references from `.blp` to `.tga`
- TGA files are **natively supported** by WoW 3.3.5a - no conversion needed!
- Each TGA tile is ~1MB (1,048,594 bytes) - perfectly normal for uncompressed 512x512 textures

### 3. Files Created
```
✓ AzsharaCrater1.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater2.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater3.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater4.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater5.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater6.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater7.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater8.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater9.tga  - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater10.tga - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater11.tga - 1,048,594 bytes
✓ AzsharaCrater12.tga - 1,048,594 bytes
```

## How to Test

1. **In-Game**: Type `/reload` to reload the addon
2. **Open Map**: Press `M` to open world map
3. **Go to Azshara Crater**: Teleport to zone or check map for Map ID 614
4. **Debug Info**: Type `/dcmap status` to see detection info
5. **Test Textures**: Type `/dcmap blptest` (now tests TGA files)

## Expected Results

✅ **Zone Detection**: Should show "Azshara detected via map ID: 614"
✅ **Tiles Loaded**: Should show "Loaded 12/12 tiles (0 failed)"
✅ **Map Display**: Your custom Azshara Crater map should appear (no more rainbow corruption!)
✅ **POIs Visible**: Location markers should display on custom map
✅ **Player Position**: Yellow dot should track your position

## Why TGA Instead of BLP?

1. **WoW 3.3.5a Native Support**: TGA files work perfectly without conversion
2. **No Corruption**: TGA format is straightforward and reliable
3. **Easier Workflow**: No need for BLPConverter or format issues
4. **Same Performance**: WoW handles both BLP and TGA equally well

The old BLP files were corrupted (likely wrong format/compression). TGA sidesteps all those issues!

## Tile Layout

```
Your map is split into a 4x3 grid:

[Tile 1] [Tile 2] [Tile 3] [Tile 4]
[Tile 5] [Tile 6] [Tile 7] [Tile 8]
[Tile 9] [Tile10] [Tile11] [Tile12]

Each tile is 512x512 pixels
Total map size: 2048x1536 pixels
```

## For Hyjal Map

If you have `hyjal.png`, run the same script:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\flori\Desktop\WoW Server\Azeroth Fork\DarkChaos-255\Custom\Client addons needed\DC-MapExtension"
.\convert_map_to_tiles.ps1 -SourceImage "C:\Users\flori\Desktop\WoW Server\hyjal.png" -MapName "Hyjal"
```

## Troubleshooting

If tiles don't show:
1. Check debug mode: `/dcmap debug`
2. Verify zone detection: `/dcmap status`
3. Check file paths in error messages
4. Ensure TGA files exist: `ls Textures\AzsharaCrater\*.tga`

## File Sizes Comparison

Old corrupted BLP files: 44-88 KB (inconsistent = corrupted)
New TGA files: 1,048,594 bytes each (consistent = correct!)

The TGA files are larger but WoW handles them perfectly. If you want smaller files later, you can convert TGA to proper BLP1 format using BLPConverter, but **it's not necessary** - TGA works great!

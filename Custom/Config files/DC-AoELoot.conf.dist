#    AoELoot.Range
#        Description: Maximum range (in yards) to collect loot from nearby corpses
#                     When a player loots one corpse, all lootable corpses within

#                     Prevents server lag from looting excessive numbers of corpses.
#                     Even if 50 corpses are in range, only this many will be looted.
#        Default:     10

#        Options:     0 = Force open loot windows (never auto-loot)
#                     1 = Force auto-loot all corpses (bypass client setting)

#        Default:     Commented out (no delay)
#        Range:       0 - 500 (higher values make looting slower but reduce lag)
#
#AoELoot.LootDelay = 50

#
#    AoELoot.ShowCount
#        Description: Show how many corpses were looted in the confirmation message
#                     Example: "You looted 7 nearby corpses!" vs "Nearby corpses looted!"

#                     WoW 3.3.5a clients have a 16-slot loot window. This setting prevents

#        Default:     15 (leaves one spare slot)
#        Range:       1 - 16 (setting to 16 may cause client issues)

#                     credited to the looter when they are solo (not in a group).
#                     When disabled, gold remains in the loot window for normal

#

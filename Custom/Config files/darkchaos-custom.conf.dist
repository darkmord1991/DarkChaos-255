#        Description: Delay in minutes between hotspot spawns
#                     When a hotspot expires, the system waits this long before

#                     - Triggers XP bonus via PlayerScript hook (checks HasAura of this spell)
#                     
#                     CRITICAL: Use ONLY ONE spell ID for both effects to avoid conflicts!
#                     Using different spells for AuraSpell and BuffSpell will cause interference.
#                     
#                     Recommended: Custom spell 800001 (included in server scripts)

#        Default:     500.0
#        Range:       100.0 - 5000.0 (larger = more visible from further away)

#                     Zone ID 0 means "all zones" for that map.
#

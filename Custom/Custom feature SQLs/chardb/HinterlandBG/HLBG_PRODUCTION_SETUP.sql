-- ==================================================
-- CONFIGURATION HELP
-- ==================================================
-- If you need to configure hlbg_config manually, use the structure shown above.
-- Common patterns are:
-- INSERT INTO hlbg_config (column1, column2) VALUES ('setting', 'value');
-- 
-- The core systems (seasons, weather, affixes) are now fully operational
-- regardless of hlbg_config structure.
-- ==================================================

-- ==================================================

# Seasonal System Integration - Implementation Complete

**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully integrated all DarkChaos seasonal systems under a unified framework. All systems now use the generic `SeasonalManager` for consistent season tracking and transitions.

## Systems Integrated

### 1. Seasonal Reward System ✅
- **Implementation:** `SeasonalRewardSystem` now implements `SeasonalParticipant` interface
- **Registration:** Auto-registers with `SeasonalManager` on server startup
- **Season Source:** Queries `SeasonalManager->GetActiveSeason()` first, falls back to config
- **Callbacks:** Implements all lifecycle methods:
  - `OnSeasonStart()` - Loads reward definitions for new season
  - `OnSeasonEnd()` - Finalizes player rewards
  - `OnPlayerSeasonChange()` - Archives old stats, initializes new season
  - `InitializeForSeason()` - Loads quest/creature rewards from database
  - `CleanupFromSeason()` - Saves all player stats

### 2. Mythic+ System ✅
- **Implementation:** `MythicDifficultyScaling.cpp` now checks `SeasonalManager` first
- **Helper:** Created `MythicPlusSeasonalIntegration.cpp` with 3-tier fallback:
  1. Generic `SeasonalManager` (primary)
  2. M+ specific `dc_mplus_seasons` table (backward compatibility)
  3. Config `DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID` (last resort)
- **Integration:** `LoadConfiguration()` method updated with SeasonalSystem.h include

### 3. Item Upgrade System ✅
- **Implementation:** `Mechanics_GetCurrentSeason()` now queries `SeasonalManager`
- **Fallback:** Uses config `DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID` if manager unavailable
- **Remove Hardcode:** Eliminated hardcoded `return 1;` - now dynamic

### 4. HLBG System ✅ (Already Integrated)
- **Status:** Was already using generic framework correctly
- **Implementation:** `HLBGSeasonalParticipant.cpp` serves as gold standard
- **No Changes:** System working as designed

## Configuration Updates

### New Unified Setting
```ini
###########################################################################
#    SECTION 10: UNIFIED SEASONAL SYSTEM
###########################################################################

# Global active season for ALL systems
DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID = 1

# Backward compatibility (deprecated - use DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID)
SeasonalRewards.ActiveSeasonID = 1
```

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for season ID
- All systems transition together
- Backward compatible with existing configs
- Clear migration path for admins

## Code Architecture

### Unified Season Flow
```
Server Startup
    ↓
SeasonalManager Initializes
    ↓
SeasonalRewardSystem Registers (via SeasonalRewardWorldScript)
    ├─ Implements SeasonalParticipant interface
    ├─ Provides callbacks for season events
    └─ Loads reward definitions
    ↓
M+ System Queries SeasonalManager
    ├─ MythicDifficultyScaling.LoadConfiguration()
    ├─ Falls back to dc_mplus_seasons table
    └─ Uses GetMythicPlusActiveSeason() helper
    ↓
Item Upgrades Query SeasonalManager
    ├─ Mechanics_GetCurrentSeason()
    └─ Falls back to config
    ↓
All Systems Use Same Season ID ✅
```

### Season Transition Flow
```
Admin Command: .season set 2
    ↓
SeasonalManager->TransitionSeason(1, 2)
    ↓
Fires SEASON_EVENT_END for Season 1
    ├─ SeasonalRewardSystem->OnSeasonEnd(1)
    │   └─ Finalizes rewards, saves stats
    ├─ M+ System receives event
    └─ HLBG System receives event
    ↓
Fires SEASON_EVENT_START for Season 2
    ├─ SeasonalRewardSystem->OnSeasonStart(2)
    │   ├─ Updates active season config
    │   └─ Loads Season 2 reward definitions
    ├─ M+ System reloads affixes/scaling
    └─ HLBG System resets rankings
    ↓
For Each Player:
    SeasonalRewardSystem->OnPlayerSeasonChange(guid, 1, 2)
    ├─ Archives Season 1 stats
    ├─ Initializes Season 2 stats
    └─ Saves to database
    ↓
All Systems Now on Season 2 ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

### Season Transitions
- [ ] Start server → verify all systems load same season ID
- [ ] Change season via `.season set 2` command
- [ ] Verify M+ affixes change for new season
- [ ] Verify item upgrades use new season
- [ ] Verify seasonal rewards load Season 2 definitions
- [ ] Check player stats archived correctly

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Server starts with only `SeasonalRewards.ActiveSeasonID` set (no DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID)
- [ ] M+ system falls back to dc_mplus_seasons table if SeasonalManager unavailable
- [ ] Item upgrades fall back to config if SeasonalManager unavailable
- [ ] Old player stats preserved from Season 1

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete quest → receive seasonal tokens (correct season tracked)
- [ ] Kill world boss → receive seasonal essence (correct season tracked)
- [ ] Run M+ dungeon → correct season affixes applied
- [ ] Upgrade item → uses current season's upgrade path
- [ ] HLBG match → stats recorded to current season

### Configuration Tests
- [ ] Change `DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID` → all systems reflect change
- [ ] Reload config → systems pick up new season
- [ ] Set invalid season ID → systems handle gracefully

### Logging Verification
- [ ] Check `server.loading` log for SeasonalRewards registration message
- [ ] Check M+ LoadConfiguration logs for season source (SeasonalManager vs dc_mplus_seasons)
- [ ] Check ItemUpgrades Mechanics_GetCurrentSeason() logs
- [ ] Verify no errors about missing SeasonalManager (should be warnings only)

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead ✅
- Season ID lookup cached after first query
- Database queries only on season transitions
- No additional runtime overhead for reward calculations
- Backward compatibility maintains existing performance

### Scalability
- All systems share single season management code
- Easy to add new seasonal systems in future
- Centralized event firing reduces duplicate logic

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Database Consolidation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Merged `dc_mplus_seasons` into `dc_seasons` table (add `season_type` column)
- ✅ Consolidated `dc_weekly_vault` + `dc_player_seasonal_chests` into `dc_player_weekly_rewards`
- ✅ Created backward compatibility SQL views for zero-downtime migration
- ✅ Archived old tables for rollback safety

**Migration Scripts:**
- `02_CONSOLIDATE_SEASONS_DATABASE.sql` - Full consolidation with automated migration
- `03_ROLLBACK_CONSOLIDATION.sql` - Rollback script if issues occur

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Single weekly reset logic across all systems
- Unified vault with M+ runs + seasonal rewards
- Cross-system reward tracking (e.g., M+ tokens + quest essence in same vault)
- Reduced database fragmentation
- Easier season management

### Admin Interface 🔮
- Create unified `.season` command suite for all systems
- Add `.season info` to show all system status
- Add `.season sync` to force all systems to same season

### Cross-System Features 🔮
- Seasonal achievements that track all systems
- Weekly rewards that combine M+, dungeons, quests
- Season-ending rewards based on total progression

## Migration Guide

### For Server Admins

1. **Update Config File**
   ```ini
   # Add this to darkchaos-custom.conf
   DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID = 1
   ```

2. **Rebuild Server**
   ```bash
   # All new files are in CMakeLists.txt
   ./acore.sh compiler build
   ```

3. **Verify Logs on Startup**
   ```
   >> [SeasonalRewards] Using season 1 from SeasonalManager
   >> [SeasonalRewards] Registered with SeasonalManager
   >> Active Mythic+ season from generic system (ID 1)
   ```

4. **Test Season Transition**
   ```
   # In-game as admin
   .season set 2
   # Check all systems reflect Season 2
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Adding New Seasonal System**
   ```cpp
   // 1. Implement SeasonalParticipant interface
   class MySystemSeasonalParticipant : public DarkChaos::Seasonal::SeasonalParticipant {
       std::string GetSystemName() const override { return "my_system"; }
       uint32 GetSystemVersion() const override { return 100; }
       void OnSeasonStart(uint32 season_id) override { /* ... */ }
       void OnSeasonEnd(uint32 season_id) override { /* ... */ }
       // ... other methods
   };
   
   // 2. Register with SeasonalManager in WorldScript
   if (DarkChaos::Seasonal::GetSeasonalManager()) {
       SystemRegistration reg;
       reg.system_name = "my_system";
       // ... configure callbacks
       GetSeasonalManager()->RegisterSystem(reg);
   }
   
   // 3. Query season ID
   uint32 currentSeason = GetSeasonalManager()->GetCurrentSeasonId();
   ```

2. **Using Seasonal Data**
   ```cpp
   // Always check if SeasonalManager is available
   if (DarkChaos::Seasonal::GetSeasonalManager()) {
       auto* season = GetSeasonalManager()->GetActiveSeason();
       if (season) {
           // Use season->season_id, season->start_timestamp, etc.
       }
   } else {
       // Fallback to config or hardcoded value
       uint32 season = sConfigMgr->GetOption<uint32>("DarkChaos.ActiveSeasonID", 1);
   }
   ```

## Success Metrics

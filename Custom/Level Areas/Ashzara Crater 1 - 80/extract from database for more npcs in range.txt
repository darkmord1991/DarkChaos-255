-- Generate a curated list of normal (non-elite) combat NPCs from your AzerothCore world DB
-- grouped by level ranges for Vanilla/TBC/WotLK (max level 80).
--
-- Output columns: entry, name, minlevel, maxlevel, wowhead_wotlk_url
--
-- Notes:
-- - Filters to rank = 0 (normal) and npcflag = 0 (non-vendor/guard/questgiver) to bias toward combat mobs.
-- - Adjust WHERE clauses if you want to include vendors/questgivers or elites.
-- - ORDER BY favors lower minlevel and alphabetical names; tweak as desired.
-- - LIMIT per range can be adjusted for more/less results.
--
-- How to use:
--   1) Switch to your world database (e.g., `USE acore_world;`).
--   2) Run this script.
--   3) Copy the results for each section. The wowhead URLs point to WotLK database pages.

-- Helper: common selection projection
-- We duplicate the projection across ranges for compatibility with MySQL console.
